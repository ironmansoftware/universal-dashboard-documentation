## Published Folders

### Publishing a folder

You can publish a folder by specifying the path to the folder. The RequestPath is the path that the web server will server the files.

```text
$Folder = Publish-UDFolder -Path C:\data\ -RequestPath "/config"

$Dashboard = New-UDDashboard -Title "Published Folders" -Content {}

Start-UDDashboard -Dashboard $Dashboard -Port 9999 -PublishedFolder $Folder
```

You can download a file by invoking the request path.

```text
C:\> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:9999/config/hi.txt
