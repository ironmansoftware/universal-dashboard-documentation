## WS-Federation

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is not supported in Community Edition
{% endhint %}

WS-Federation supports both Active Directory Federation Services and Azure Active Directory.

You first need to configure ADFS or AzureAD to support Universal Dashboard.

### Configuring ADFS for Universal Dashboard

#### Service Settings

These are the current Federation Service settings for our domain.

#### Relying Parties

You need to configure the following Relying Parties settings for Universal Dashboard. On the Identifiers tab, provide the URL to the Universal Dashboard website. HTTPS is required.

On the Endpoints tab. You'll need to include a WS-Federation Passive Endpoint. Make sure to include the trailing slash.

Finally, you'll need to configure a Claim Issuance Policy for the Relying Party Trust. Create an Issuance Transform Rule that sends at least the Name and Name ID to Universal Dashboard.

You can configure additional claims you'd like to use if you are using Claims-based Authorization in Universal Dashboard.

### Configuring For Azure Active Directory

Follow the documentation for the Azure Active Directory configuration found on this [Microsoft Document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/ws-federation?view=aspnetcore-2.2#azure-active-directory).

### Configuring Universal Dashboard

After configuring ADFS or AAD, you can now use the `New-UDAuthenticationMethod` cmdlet to connect to your WS-Fed instance. For our ADFS instance, this is the authentication method configuration we are using.

```text
$Authentication = New-UDAuthenticationMethod -MetadataAddress 'https://ironman.local:443/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml' -Wtrealm https://ironman.local:12345
$LoginPage = New-UDLoginPage -AuthenticationMethod $Authentication
```

When running your dashboard, you should now be prompted for your credentials either via the Internet Explorer single-sign system or you will be forwarded to the WS-Fed login page.
