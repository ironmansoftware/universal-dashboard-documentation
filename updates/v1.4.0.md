For an example of a JavaScript-based custom element, visit the [UniversalDashboard.Sparklines GitHub repository](https://github.com/ironmansoftware/ud-sparklines).

Documentation on custom elements can be found [here](../components/custom-components/).

## Themes

Themes can now be selected with the `Get-UDTheme` cmdlet. There are x built in themes to choose from. Themes can be provided to the `New-UDDashboard` cmdlet.

You can create custom themes with `New-UDTheme`. You can also base your custom theme on a built in theme to modify only certain colors.

Creating new themes based on existing themes is as easy as this.

```text
$Theme = New-UDTheme -Name "Custom" -Definition @{
    'UDTable' = @{
         'BackgroundColor' = '#123123'
    }
} -Parent Azure
```

Documentation on themes can be found [here](../themes.md).
